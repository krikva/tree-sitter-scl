## About SCL
SCL (Structured Control Language) is a high-level textual programming language used in Siemens SIMATIC STEP 7 and TIA Portal for programming PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers).

## Standards and Specifications
SCL is based on the international standard IEC 61131-3, which defines programming languages for programmable controllers. SCL specifically follows the Structured Text (ST) language specification from this standard, with Siemens-specific extensions and adaptations.

Key standards and specifications:
- IEC 61131-3: International standard for PLC programming languages
- Siemens implementation follows the ST (Structured Text) component of this standard
- Contains Siemens-specific extensions to the ST language

## Features
This Tree-sitter grammar provides syntax highlighting, code folding, and other language features for SCL files in compatible editors.
